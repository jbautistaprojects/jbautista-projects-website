      My name is Justina and I love going on adventures.  Whether it's quick days trips or weeks at a time. Currently, I am in the process of building a livable, family friendly camper with the ultimate goal to travel across the country in a camper and explore what each state has to offer.  Professionaly, I am an Electrical Engineer by degree, and a textile worker by trade.  I love science, and I love to learn and try new things.  After starting a family, I decided to start a new professinal career that allows me more flexibility to continue my career but also focus on my family.  I have always enjoyed small software projects so starting a career in software engineering seemed like the most logical choice.  </p>
